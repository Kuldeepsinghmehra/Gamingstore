          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Mastering Core Mechanics</h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Understanding and mastering the core mechanics of Modern Warfare is crucial for success. This includes weapon handling, movement, and map knowledge. Here are some key tips:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Weapon Proficiency:</strong> Spend time in the Gunsmith customizing your weapons. Experiment with different attachments to find the setup that suits your playstyle. Recoil control and aim down sight (ADS) speed are vital for winning gunfights.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Movement:</strong> Master the art of slide canceling and bunny hopping to make yourself a harder target. Movement fluidity can give you a significant edge in close-quarters combat.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Map Knowledge:</strong> Learning the layout of each map, including high-traffic areas and popular camping spots, can help you anticipate enemy movements and plan your strategy accordingly.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Effective Strategies</h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Implementing effective strategies can turn the tide of battle in your favor. Here are some essential strategies to keep in mind:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Communication:</strong> If you're playing in a team, communication is key. Use callouts to inform your teammates of enemy positions and coordinate your tactics. A well-coordinated team can outmaneuver and outgun opponents.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Objective Play:</strong> In modes like Domination or Hardpoint, playing the objective is crucial. Secure and defend objectives to earn points and control the flow of the match. Use tactical equipment like smoke grenades to obscure enemy sightlines and create opportunities for your team.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Killstreaks:</strong> Earning and utilizing killstreaks effectively can provide significant advantages. UAVs, Counter UAVs, and Precision Airstrikes can disrupt enemy plans and create openings for your team.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Cheat Codes and Tips</h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            While cheat codes are not officially supported in Modern Warfare, there are several in-game tips and tricks that can enhance your gameplay:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Field Upgrades:</strong> Utilize field upgrades like Dead Silence and Stopping Power Rounds to gain a temporary edge in combat. These upgrades can turn the tide in critical moments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Perks:</strong> Choose perks that complement your playstyle. Perks like E.O.D. (reduces explosive damage) and Ghost (makes you undetectable by UAVs) can provide significant advantages in various scenarios.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advanced Tips:</strong> Practice jump-shotting and drop-shotting to make yourself a more difficult target. These advanced movement techniques can give you the upper hand in gunfights.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            In conclusion, mastering Call of Duty: Modern Warfare requires a combination of skill, strategy, and adaptability. By honing your weapon proficiency, perfecting your movement, and implementing effective strategies, you can elevate your gameplay and dominate the battlefield.
