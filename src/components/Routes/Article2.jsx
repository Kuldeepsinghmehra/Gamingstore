          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Mastering Key Moves</h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Kratos is equipped with the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos, each offering a unique combat style. Mastering the moves associated with these weapons is crucial for surviving the harsh environments and formidable enemies of the game.

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Leviathan Axe Combos:</strong> The Leviathan Axe can be thrown for ranged attacks or used in close combat. Key combos include the Light Attack combo (R1, R1, R1) and the Heavy Attack combo (R2, R2). The Leviathan Axe can also freeze enemies, providing strategic advantages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Blades of Chaos Combos:</strong> The Blades of Chaos are perfect for crowd control. Combos like Whirlwind Throw (L1 + R1) and Hyperion Slam (R2 while sprinting) can deal massive damage to multiple enemies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shield Combat:</strong> Kratos' shield is essential for defense and parrying. Timing your parries (L1 just before an enemy attack) can open up foes for counterattacks.
            </li>
          </ul>
